Problem 00:
Given a string consisting of empty cells (_), fences (|), one dog (d), and 
one squirrel (s).  In 2 units of time, the squirrel can move 1 no matter 
what.  In 1 unit of time, the dog can move to an empty cell.  In 2 units 
of time the dog can jump on top of a fence.  (It only takes 1 time unit
for the dog to jump down.)  At what time will the dog catch the squirrel?

examples:
___d__s___ time:0
____d_s___ time:1
_____d_s__ time:2
______ds__ time:3
_______ds_ time:4
________x_ time:5

___d_|s___ time:0

Problem 01:
As a simple checksum you come up with a method of doing a digital sum 
repeatedly until you get one digit.  Write a program to do this for
you.

example:
123456  1+2+3+4+5+6=21
21 1+2=3
3

input:
123456
654321
6543217
99999

output:
3
3
1
9

Problem 02:
Give two fractions.  Add them and express as a mixed fraction.

example:
4/5 2/5    4/5+2/5=6/5=1 1/5

input:
4/5 2/5
1/3 1/6
1/3 1/6
1/3 3/9
1/3 3/2

output:
1 1/5
1/2
2/3
0
1 5/6


Problem 03:
You are given a number.  This number can be expressed as a sum of two 
numbers.  What is the maximum number of 1's you could use for both of 
these numbers combined?

example:
4 -> 100base2  11base2+1base2=100base2
3 1's

input:
4
...

output:
3
...
